					PokeSwarm is a pet project for logging Pokemon Go sightings. The purpose is to get enough
					data to start spotting trends. Simply put; we want to be able to tell you where to go to find a Pokemon
					based on the data the community has provided.

					Currently we're in alpha, just getting started with a fairly limited amount of data. Once we stabilise
					the platform, it'll be about adding features, crafting a better user experience, and smoothing out bugs.
